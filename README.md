# MERN Stack Application with Docker Compose

This project demonstrates how to **containerize a MERN stack application** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) using **Docker Compose** to easily run the entire stack locally in isolated containers.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project involves setting up a complete MERN stack application and deploying it using Docker and Docker Compose. Docker Compose allows you to define and manage multi-container Docker applications, making it easy to run the application on any machine without worrying about dependencies or configuration issues.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database for storing application data
- **Express.js** – Backend framework for building the API
- **React.js** – Frontend framework for building the user interface
- **Node.js** – Runtime environment for running the JavaScript code on the server
- **Docker** – Containerization platform
- **Docker Compose** – Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications

## 📦 Features

- **Easy Setup** – Deploy the MERN stack with a single command using Docker Compose
- **Isolated Containers** – MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js run in separate containers
- **Environment Variables** – Sensitive data like database URL and port are configured using `.env` files
- **Local Deployment** – Works seamlessly on your local machine for development and testing
